# Jira 2 Itop
This quick and dirty script can be used to import your Jira issues into the ITSM called Itop.
It imports the following :
- Issue
- Comments
- Attachments

And with the following options :
- Close the ticket if closed on Jira.
- Set a creation and closing date.

It's not fool proof as I don't really handle errors we contacting Jira's API or Itop's API.
